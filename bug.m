This code attempts to access an array element using an index that's outside the bounds of the array.  This can lead to a crash or unpredictable behavior.

```objectivec
NSArray *myArray = @[@1, @2, @3];
NSInteger index = 5; // Index out of bounds
NSNumber *value = myArray[index]; // Crash or unexpected behavior
NSLog(@"Value at index %ld: %@
", (long)index, value);
```
